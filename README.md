# Embedded-Soc-Flash-memory-and-Bootloader-
A hardware/software SoC design for the DE10-Lite board where a Nios II CPU reads program code from on-chip flash memory and drives VGA output. The project demonstrates a full HW/SW boot flow, custom VHDL top-level integration, and a C-based application running on the soft-core processor.
